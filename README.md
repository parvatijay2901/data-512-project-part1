# Course Project: Part 1 - Common Analysis
## Impact of Wildfires on the city of Vancouver, WA

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the impacts of wildfires on the city of Vancouver, WA, with a specific focus on estimating and understanding the effects of wildfire smoke on public health and air quality over the last 60 years, from 1961 to 2021. ​This analysis aims to produce annual estimates of wildfire smoke impacts based on data from wildland fire occurrences within a 650-mile radius of Vancouver.​ By leveraging historical wildfire data, Air Quality Index (AQI) metrics, and predictive modeling techniques, the project seeks to accomplish the following key objectives:
- Estimate Annual Smoke Impact: Create a method for estimating the annual impact of wildfire smoke on Vancouver, WA, considering factors such as the intensity and proximity of wildfires. This estimation will serve as a quantitative representation of the smoke's influence on the city's environment and public health.
- Visualize Historical Trends: Produce visual representations (histograms and time series graphs) of key metrics related to wildfires, including the distribution of wildfire occurrences by distance from the city, total acres burned per year, and comparisons between estimated smoke impacts and AQI values.
- Inform Policy Decisions: Provide insights and data to inform city managers, policymakers, and other civic institutions in their planning and decision-making processes concerning wildfire management, public health interventions, and air quality improvement strategies.
- Forecast Future Impacts: Develop a predictive model that forecasts smoke estimates for the next 25 years (2025-2050), enabling Vancouver to prepare for potential future wildfire smoke impacts. This forecast will include confidence intervals to represent the uncertainty associated with smoke estimates.

Through this project, the analysis aims not only to quantify the historical impacts of wildfires in Vancouver, WA but also to contribute to the broader understanding of how wildfire smoke affects urban environments, ultimately aiding in the development of more effective mitigation strategies.

This project follows to the best practices for open scientific research as mentioned in chapters "Assessing Reproducibility" and "The Basic Reproducible Workflow Template" of ["The Practice of Reproducible Research: Case Studies and Lessons from the Data-Intensive Sciences"](https://www.ucpress.edu/books/the-practice-of-reproducible-research/paper) publication, ensuring transparency and reproducibility throughout the process.

### Datasets used
- **USGS Wildland Fire Combined Dataset**: This dataset serves as the primary source of data for the project and contains comprehensive wildfire data. The dataset was downloaded from this [link](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81) as part of the 'GeoJSON Files.zip' file. It is cited by Welty, J.L., and Jeffries, M.I. (2021). Combined wildland fire datasets for the United States and certain territories, 1800s-Present: U.S. Geological Survey data release. [doi](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9ZXGFY3). While the specific usage policy for this dataset is not explicitly stated, it is assumed to be safe to use.
- **Air Quality Index Data**: Air Quality Data was needed to evaluate the performance of the smoke estimate created. This data was requested from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Service (AQS) API. This is a historical API and does not provide real-time air quality data. The [documentation](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) for the API provides definitions of the different call parameter and examples of the various calls that can be made to the API. The US EPA was created in the early 1970's. The EPA reports that they only started broad based monitoring with standardized quality assurance procedures in the 1980's. Many counties will have data starting somewhere between 1983 and 1988. However, some counties still do not have any air quality monitoring stations. The API helps resolve this by providing calls to search for monitoring stations and data using either station ids, or a county designation or a geographic bounding box. Some additional information on the Air Quality System can be found in the [EPA FAQ on the system](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/frequent-questions-about-airdata). The AQS API is publicly accessible and provides access to ambient air sample data collected by various pollution control agencies. Users are expected to be familiar with the terms of service that govern the use of the API. These [terms](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html#terms) outline acceptable usage practices and any restrictions on data access and storage
