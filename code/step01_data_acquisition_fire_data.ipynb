    "## Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "More and more frequently summers in the western US have been characterized by wildfires with smoke billowing across multiple western states. There are many proposed causes for this: climate change, US Forestry policy, growing awareness, just to name a few. Regardless of the cause, the impact of wildland fires is widespread as wildfire smoke reduces the air quality of many cities. There is a growing body of work pointing to the negative impacts of smoke on health, tourism, property, and other aspects of society.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Course Project is designed to analyze the impacts of wildfires on specific cities in the United States, particularly focusing on the effects of wildfire smoke and its implications for public health, air quality, and overall community well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first step in the project, where all the students conduct a base analysis using a shared dataset while focusing on a unique city. The aim is to create an understanding of wildfire impacts tailored to local contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we primarily obtain the Access to the historical data of wildfires, and compute the average distance between the city assigned to me and the fire perimeter as this is required to obtain the smoke estimate. We will talk more about this estimate in the next notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "The primary dataset used in this project is the [Combined Wildland Fire Datasets for the United States and Certain Territories (1800s-Present)](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81), which is sourced from the US Geological Survey (USGS). This dataset is particularly notable for several key characteristics:\n",
    "- **Comprehensive:** It merges data from 40 different sources into a single dataset that provides detailed information on wildfires and prescribed fires across the United States from the mid-1800s to the present.\n",
    "- **Geographic Coverage:** Includes entire United States and certain territories, making it applicable for a variety of urban analyses.\n",
    "- **Variables Included:** The dataset includes essential attributes such as: Fire Name, Ignition Date, Controlled Date, Containment Date, Fire Cause, Fire Polygons\n",
    "-  **Temporal Range:** The dataset covers a long historical period, allowing for analyses of trends over time and the assessment of changes in wildfire patterns and impacts.\n",
    "- **Summary Statistics:** It provides spatial summary statistics, such as the frequency of fires in specific geographic areas, enabling a more robust analysis of smoke impacts on communities over the years.\n",
    "- **Data Formats:** Available in both ArcGIS and GeoJSON formats, making it accessible for various data processing and geographic information system (GIS) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is intended for public use, allowing researchers, students, and policymakers to access and analyze data related to wildfires.​ Users are encouraged to employ the data responsibly, ensuring that analyses and representations accurately reflect the information contained within the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Load the wildfire data using the wildfire Reader object\n",
    "In the following cells we provide small code snippets that do the following:\n",
    "- Create a wildfire Reader() object and use it to open the sample data file. Once, opened, we have access to the header information so we print that to show the structure of that data.\n",
    "- Use the Reader() object and the next() method to read a set of wildfire features. The small sample file should have 15 of them. \n",
    "- Print one example feature showing the dictionary data structure of a feature.\n",
    "- Access the geometry of one specific feature to get the 'ring' boundary of that specific fire - which is a list of geodetic coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some of the output cells are quite long. Once you understand what they are illustrating you might want to collapse them or comment out the print statements that generate the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another note regarding terminology. In the GeoJSON standard, something that is to be represented geographically is generically called a 'feature'. In the case of the wildfire dataset every 'feature' is a wildfire. These terms are used somewhat interchangably below."
